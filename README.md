***I do not use error handling in this project - due to better readability and simplicity of the code, but you can check the error handling in the same project I made using Flask and MongoDB here: https://github.com/emax-77/Inventory-Managemet-System-Flask-MongoDB.git***

# Inventory Management System
## Simple IMS for small business using Django

### Easy to run - Django with SQLite3 only

***if you want to try email notifications, you need to set up your email configuration in settings.py***
